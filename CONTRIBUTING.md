# **Contributing to Restwave - Join the Wave!** 🌊

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Restwave. We appreciate your interest in making our project even better! 🎉

## **We Embrace the Wave Spirit** 🌟

Restwave is all about collaboration, innovation, and having a blast while coding. We want you to enjoy the journey of contributing as much as we do. So, let's ride the wave together and make some epic contributions!

## **How Can You Contribute?** 🚀

There are several ways you can contribute to Restwave:

1. **Bug Reports**: If you come across any bugs or issues while using Restwave, let us know! Submit a detailed bug report with steps to reproduce the issue. Bonus points for including a funny GIF to lighten the mood.

2. **Feature Requests**: Got an awesome idea for a new feature? Share it with us! Open an issue and describe your feature request. Be creative and persuasive—convince us why it would rock Restwave!

3. **Pull Requests**: Ready to dive into code? We'd love to see your pull requests! Whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, or an improvement, fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Add some witty comments in your code to make us smile. If you're looking for ideas, check out the issues section for existing tasks and feature requests that you can tackle.

## **Code Style and Guidelines** ✨

To keep the codebase clean and maintainable, we follow these guidelines:

- Indentation: We use tabs, not spaces. Let's keep the peace between the tab vs. space warriors!
- Naming Conventions: Be descriptive with your variable and function names. Avoid naming things like `x`, `foo`, or `magicNumber`. Let's make our code readable and magical!
- Commenting: Leave comments when necessary, but avoid unnecessary comments. Let your code speak for itself—unless it's cracking hilarious jokes, then go ahead!

## **Be Part of the Restwave Community** 🌍

Rock on! 🤘
